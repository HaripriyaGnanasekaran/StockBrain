# StockBrain

Deep learning recurrent neural network based predictions of stock movements. My active application-oriented research, currently focusses on capturing current knowledge in real-time. This feature will enable StockBrain to acquire knowledge and helps, *possibly*, predict an accurate future of stock prices.

## Information
Version: Currently developing **StockBrain 0.0.0 (Telencephalon)**. Visit branch to see the source files.  

Todo:  
```
* [ - ] Clean up source code.  
* [ - ] Generalize source code.
* [ - ] Implement OOPs and design structure.
* [ - ] Obtain user input (stock name).
* [ - ] Add results and create portfolio.
* [ - ] Quantify model for a minimum of 10 stocks.
* [ - ] Optimize the Tensorflow backend.
* [ - ] Publish first version as a software and results in arXiv as a report.
