# StockBrain

Deep learning recurrent neural network based predictions of stock movements. My active application-oriented research, currently focusses on capturing current knowledge in real-time. This feature will enable StockBrain to acquire knowledge and helps, *possibly*, predict an accurate future of stock prices.
